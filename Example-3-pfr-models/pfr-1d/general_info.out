OpenMKM is a multiphysics, multiscale, and open source software 
aimed at modelng chemical kinetics. It can run pure gas phase 
as well as surface mechanisms for heterogeneous catalysis.
OpenMKM is developed at Delaware Energy Institute, University
of Delaware. The development of OpenMKM is funded by RAPID.
